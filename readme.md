# Pig Game

Player One throws a dice and scores as many points as the total shown on the dice providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.
If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the dice to the next player.
Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
By default, whoever reaches 100 Points first wins the game, however, this can be changed with the "Change Score"- Option

This project is not responsive as I have been focussing on the functionality rather than looks.
